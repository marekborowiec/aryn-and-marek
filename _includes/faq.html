						<b>Q: What if not everyone can get vaccinated by August?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> If our U.S. and international guests are unable to gather safely by August 2021, we will postpone our celebration until the following summer. We plan to proceed with the wedding either way and plan a meaningful celebration with family and friends as soon as it is safe to do so.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Q: What is the dress code?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> Wedding casual! High temperatures in August in Joseph are typically between 70 and 90 degrees F and it gets chilly once the sun sets (around 8pm). Lows are typically around 45 degrees. It's unlikely to rain: on average there are only 2 or 3 days of rain in August. The ceremony and reception (and dancing!) will be outside, so bring comfortable footwear.

						<b>Q: Are babies allowed?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> Babies are allowed.

						<b>Q: What about my sweet pooch?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> Unfortunately, the venue is not dog friendly :-( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lin-Lee-Kennels-202632269773897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lin Lee Kennels</a> in Joseph is a place with dog and cat boarding.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Q: What is the history of this place?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> Joseph and Wallowa Mountains are located on the homelands of the Nimi'ipuu (Nez Perc√©). We extend gratitude to the indigenous people that call this place home. You can read about the story of Chief Joseph <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chief-Joseph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

						<b>Q: What is a glacial moraine?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> We're so glad you asked! It is a buildup of debris previously carried by a glacier. <a href="https://www.morainecampaign.org/#where"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallowa Lake moraines</a> are a textbook example!
