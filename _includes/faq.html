						<b>Q:</b> What if not everyone can get vaccinated by August?
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> If our U.S. and international guests are unable to gather safely by August 2021, we will postpone our celebration until the following summer. We plan to proceed with the wedding either way and plan a meaningful celebration with family and friends as soon as it is safe to do so.
