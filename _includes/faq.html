						<b>Q: What is the dress code?</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>A:</b> Wedding casual! High temperatures in August in Joseph are typically between 70 and 90 degrees F and it gets chilly once the sun sets (around 8pm). Lows are typically around 45 degrees. It's unlikely to rain: on average there are only 2 or 3 days of rain in August. The ceremony and reception (and dancing!) will be outside, so bring comfortable footwear.
